### Getting started:
We recommend installing the Anaconda distribution of Python as it comes 
with almost all required dependencies for the GUI. The latest version of the 
distribution can be found 
[here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

Download and run "FT-IM-MS GUI.py" for the GUI to open in system default
browser. "FTGUI_funcs.py", "CCS_funcs.py", and "velocityRatio.csv" are files 
with supporting functions and should be in the same directory.
